# Cost, Privacy and Copyrights

## Cost

* SammyAI is a free to use. This is achieved through a strategic combination of local and cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs). SammyAI leverages the generous free daily usage limits offered by some cloud LLM providers. Crucially, it uses local model(s) – meaning the heavy lifting happens directly on your computer – significantly reducing the resource demands and associated costs. This approach, combined with our focus on best practices, allows SammyAI to be accessible to literally anyone, regardless of their budget.

**Free Usage:**

*   SammyAI utilizes the generous free daily usage limits offered by cloud LLM providers. This means you can enjoy the core AI writing assistance without any cost. To get the most out of the free usage refer to our best practices guide [Link to Best Practices Guide - *To be created*]

**Exceeding Free Limits For Cloud Providers:**

*   **Daily Reset:**  Free limits for cloud providers are reset daily. If you exceed your daily allowance, you will need to wait until the next day for your usage to reset and continue using the cloud-based AI features for free. But remember, you have two different cloud providers and the local model that is always free, all integrated into a multi-modal chat. If you use the best practices, this will get you plenty of daily usage. 

**Existing Paid Subscriptions for Cloud Providers:**

*   **Seamless Integration:** If you already have a paid subscription with a cloud LLM provider (e.g., Google, Ollama), SammyAI will automatically utilize the benefits of your existing subscription when you use the cloud features. You don’t need to change anything!

## Privacy

* Your creative work is deeply personal. That’s why privacy is absolutely at the core of our design – SammyAI does not collect or store any user information. SammyAI operates directly on your PC. There’s no data trail, no user accounts, and no tracking of your writing process.

Here’s what that means for you:
* **Complete Anonymity:** Your creative work remains entirely private and confidential.
* **No Data Collection:** SammyAI does not collect, store, or transmit your writing, prompts, or ideas.
* **Local Operation:** SammyAI runs directly on your computer, ensuring maximum privacy and security.

**Important Considerations & Trade-offs:**

*   **Manual Session Saving:** 
    - Due to the nature of local operations with no data tracking within SammyAI, we strongly recommend that you **manually save your chat sessions** if you wish to retain a record of your interactions with the AI. SammyAI does have a "Copy Chat" button for your convenience.

*   **AI Model Reliance:** 
    - When it comes to using cloud models, there is an important rule you should always follow: NEVER EVER share what you don't want cloud models to know. 
    - SammyAI utilizes Ollama for a few powerful cloud-based models. Ollama’s policy is to **NOT** retain data sent to their cloud models, as clearly stated on their own website [https://ollama.com/cloud]. It is up to **YOU** to decide whether you believe this statement or not. 
    -  As for Google's cloud model embedded within SammyAI, everything is clear: your chats will not show up in dashboards or be visible on your google account, but both you and Google can access logs and metrics for API calls associated with your account. For more info on this you can visit Google's cloud API page at [https://docs.cloud.google.com/apis/docs/overview]

## Copyrights
* You **RETAIN** all rights to any stories, screenplays, or other creative works you generate with SammyAI.

* Your creativity and ideas are your own. That’s why SammyAI is designed to empower you, not to claim ownership of your work. SammyAI is a powerful assistant – a tool to help you achieve your creative goals.

Here’s a brief summary that pertains to copyrights when using SammyAI:
* **You own the copyright:** As the user, you are the rightful owner of your creative output.
* **No Claim to Ownership from SammyAI:** SammyAI is a tool, not an author. It assists you in the process of creating. SammyAI does not assert any claims to the copyright of the works you produce.
* **Your Vision, Your Rights:** You have complete control over how your creations are used, shared, or developed.
