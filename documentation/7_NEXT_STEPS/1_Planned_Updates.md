We are dedicated to making SammyAI more versatile and intuitive for professional environments:

- **Interface Modernization**: Incremental updates to the UI layout, color palettes, and functional accessibility.
- **Expanded File Support**: Implementing compatibility for `.odt` and `.docx` formats to facilitate seamless cross-platform editing.
- **Model Flexibility**: Introducing features that allow users to integrate custom LLMs alongside SammyAI's default high-performance models.

## 3. Core Feature Evolution
Continual refinement of our unique feature set to push the boundaries of AI-assisted writing:

- **Advanced Diff-Based Editing**: Optimizing workflows for precision editing and revision history management.
- **Enhanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Increasing processing capacity for larger knowledge bases and improving the relevance of context-aware suggestions.
