# 🎯 Optimizing Model Selection

One of SammyAI's greatest strengths is its ability to utilize both **Local** and **Cloud** models from various providers within a single session. Mastering the strategic choice between these models allows you to balance creative flexibility, processing power, and cost management.

## 🏗️ The Best of Both Worlds

SammyAI breaks the brand barrier, allowing you to switch models mid-conversation. Understanding the "personality" and technical constraints of each model type is key to a smooth writing process.

### 🏠 Local Models (e.g., Gemma)
Local models run entirely on your hardware. 
*   **Strengths**: Fast, private, and completely free to use. They are excellent for the "messy" phases of writing where you need to iterate quickly.
*   **Best For**: Brainstorming, initial idea generation, and rapid character exploration.

### ☁️ Cloud Models (e.g., Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi)
Cloud models leverage massive server clusters to provide deeper reasoning.
*   **Strengths**: Trained on broader datasets, offering superior prose quality and more complex narrative reasoning.
*   **Best For**: Final drafts, intricate plot resolution, and high-fidelity dialogue polishing.

## 💰 Strategic Cost Management

For users leveraging free tiers or managing API costs closely, a hybrid approach is the most effective strategy.

> [!TIP]
> **The Hybrid Workflow**
> Use your fast, free **Local Models** to do the heavy lifting of world-building and drafting. Once your scene is structured, switch to a **Cloud Model** for a single, high-quality pass to polish the prose.

## 🆚 Task-to-Model Mapping

| Creative Task | Recommended Type | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brainstorming** | 🏠 Local | Rapid fire ideas with zero cost. |
| **Lore Fact-Checking** | ☁️ Cloud | Access to broader general knowledge. |
| **Drafting (Fast)** | 🏠 Local | High speed prevents creative stalls. |
| **Final Prose Polish** | ☁️ Cloud | Superior linguistic nuance and flow. |
| **Deep Narrative Arc** | ☁️ Cloud | Better handling of long-range logic. |

## 🧠 The Memory & Context Factor

While local models are highly capable, they often have smaller **output context windows** compared to their cloud-based counterparts.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Long-Form Drift**
> Small local models may lose track of the plot in very long pieces of writing or sessions with massive context. If you notice your local model becoming repetitive or losing character voice during a long chapter, switch to a cloud model to "reset" the narrative quality.

## 🎭 Experimentation is Key
Don't feel locked into one model. If you're stuck on a scene, try asking the same prompt to two different models using the **Multi-Modal Chat** dropdown. The poetic interpretation of one might trigger the breakthrough that the logical interpretation of another missed.
